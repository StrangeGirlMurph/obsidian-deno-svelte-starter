# Obsidian.md Deno Svelte Starter

A template for developing Obsidian.md plugins using deno and svelte. 

What this template includes:

- Deno developer experience 
- Svelte support
- GitHub release workflow

What this template doesn't include:

- Versioning like `npm version patch` (just do it by hand)
- Your plugin idea

To use it tweak the `manifest.json`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `src/` :)
